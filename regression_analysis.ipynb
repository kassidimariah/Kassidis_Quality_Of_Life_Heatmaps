    "1. Introduction\n",
    "    This analysis examines relationships among environmental, demographic, health, and poverty metrics. The primary objectives are to:\n",
    "\n",
    "    -Identify demographic and socioeconomic factors contributing to environmental pollution (PM2.5 levels).\n",
    "    -Investigate the impact of poverty and demographic factors on health outcomes (e.g., coronary heart disease).\n",
    "    -Assess the interplay between health, poverty, and environmental metrics to guide policy recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Dataset Overview\n",
    "    The granularity of the dataset is at the census tract level. \n",
    "        Key variables analyzed:\n",
    "\n",
    "            Demographics: Percentages of racial groups such as American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Hispanic or Latino, and White.\n",
    "            Environmental Metrics: PM2.5 levels in the air and energy burden.\n",
    "            Health Metrics: Prevalence of coronary heart disease and diabetes among adults aged 18 or older.\n",
    "            Poverty Metrics: Percentage of individuals living below the poverty line, aggregated at the census tract level."

    "\n",
    "1. Durbin-Watson (0.146)\n",
    "    Indicates potential positive autocorrelation in residuals (values close to 0 suggest strong autocorrelation).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Jarque-Bera (JB): 13,827.230 (p=0.00)\n",
    "    The residuals are not normally distributed, which may affect the validity of the coefficients.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Condition Number (244)\n",
    "    A moderately high value indicates some potential multicollinearity among predictors, but it is not extreme.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "    Most predictors are statistically significant, with the exception of Percent Native Hawaiian or Pacific.\n",
    "    The model suggests that certain racial demographics, particularly American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian, Black, Hispanic, and White populations, are associated with reduced PM2.5 levels.\n",
    "    The small R-squared value (0.223) suggests that other factors not included in the model contribute to variations in PM2.5 levels.\n",
    "    Multicollinearity and non-normal residuals may require further investigation to ensure the model's robustness."
